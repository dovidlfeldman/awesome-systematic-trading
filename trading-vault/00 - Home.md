## Current state (as of 2026-08-27, ~9:35 AM ET — v3 cycle #8 done, no trades)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Contributed capital | $650.54 ($400 start + $250 deposit 2026-07-31) |
| Account value | **$583.25** (−10.3% vs contributed) — equity $581.24, cash $2.01 |
| Realized P&L to date | **−$64.99** (equity legs −$1.91; options sleeve −$63.08) — unchanged, nothing sold this cycle |
| Unrealized P&L | ≈ **−$1.40** on a $582.98 book basis (GLD −$2.72, XLE +$1.32) at the 9:31 ET marks |
| Slot 1 | **GLD** 0.686586 sh @ $424.56 avg ($291.51 basis) — held, still rank 1 |
| Slot 2 | **XLE** 4.699875 sh @ $62.02 avg ($291.50 basis) — held, still rank 2 |
| Cash | $2.01 free, **$0 unsettled** — book is ~100% deployed; $2.01 *is* the required buffer, so there is nothing to deploy |
| Options sleeve | Empty — gate open, but **no conforming GLD call is affordable**: re-verified 08-27 with a live quote — Oct 16 $420C (0.546Δ, 50 DTE, OI 7,449) marks $1,722.50 vs a $291.62 premium cap (5.9× over). **Owner decision 2026-08-25: wait for a bigger account — do NOT relax the delta/DTE spec to fit.** The sleeve stays gated by the Risk Rules v2 §4 premium cap and re-arms on its own once a conforming contract fits (~$3,800+ for GLD-class names, less for XLF/XLE). Accepted that it idles meanwhile |
| Circuit-breaker | $325 (50% of contributed capital) — checked first, account at **1.79×**. Clear |

## Standing schedule

**Scheduler installed 2026-08-25 (launchd).** The 14-day gap is fixed: three `launchd` agents in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (`com.dfeldman.trading.*`) now fire on weekdays, machine-local time = ET (DST-tracked):

| Time (ET) | Agent | Script | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9:30 AM | daily-cycle | `run-daily-cycle.sh` | **Full** rotation (signals → sells → buys → log → push) |
| 12:30 PM | market-check-midday | `run-market-check.sh` | **Risk exits only** — breaker + protective sleeve close; no buys/rotation |
| 3:45 PM | market-check-close | `run-market-check.sh` | Same risk-exits-only check, 15 min before close |

- The two intraday checks run the canonical `automation/market-check-prompt.md`: circuit-breaker first, then close the options sleeve only if the underlying's 20-day return turned negative or the contract is <21 DTE. They **never** buy or rotate — rebalancing is the 9:30 cycle's job alone.
- **Vault mirror:** every run copies the whole vault (`00 - Home.md` plus `Trades/`, `Signals/`, `Checks/`, `Journal/`, `Strategy/`) into `~/TradingVaultMirror/` via `automation/mirror-trades.sh`, preserving structure — so trade notes land in `Trading/Trades/`, not flat in `Trading/`. `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Trading` is a symlink to that path: `~/Documents` is TCC-protected and launchd cannot write there. One-way; the repo stays the git source of truth.
- **Root cause of the old gap:** there was never any cron/launchd entry at all — the 08-05 and 08-25 runs were both manual. Liveness now visible via `automation/logs/launchd-*.{out,err}` and the per-run `cycle-*`/`check-*` logs.
- Kill switch: `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.dfeldman.trading.<label>` for any agent, or revoke the Robinhood connector.
- Machine must be awake at the fire time; if asleep, launchd runs the job once on wake.
- **Scheduler proven 2026-08-26:** the 9:30 daily-cycle agent fired on its own and ran the full cycle end-to-end (breaker → signals → sells → buys → log → push) with no manual ping. The [[2026-08-25 Automation Gap]] is closed in practice, not just in config. Orders are held to 9:35 by the cycle's open-volatility gate; read-only work runs during the wait.
- Still untested: `review_option_order` / `place_option_order` under the desktop allowlist. Nothing affordable came up to exercise them.
- **Scheduler proven again 2026-08-27:** second consecutive unattended 9:30 cycle, full path (breaker → signals → sells → buys → log → push) with no manual ping.
- **Next cycle (Fri 2026-08-28, 9:30 ET):** rotation checks on GLD/XLE. The 08-26 RSI worry is off the table — GLD pulled back −1.6% and its RSI cooled to 66.1, seven points of headroom. The live risk now is **rank erosion, not overheating**: the qualifier bench is thin (only TLT +1.45% and XLF +0.59% behind the book), so if GLD or XLE rolls over, slot 2 could go to a weak name or to cash rather than a strong replacement. Book stays fully deployed with $2.01 cash, so a rotation can sell but **cannot redeploy proceeds until T+1** — the one-day cash gap risk carries over unchanged. Sleeve stays empty while GLD holds slot 1 (it only becomes reachable if slot 1 rotates to XLF/XLE).
