## Current state (as of 2026-08-25, ~12:01 PM ET — v3 cycle #6 done)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Contributed capital | $650.54 ($400 start + $250 deposit 2026-07-31) |
| Account value at cycle start | $585.09 (−10.1% vs contributed) |
| Realized P&L to date | **−$64.99** (equity legs −$1.91; options sleeve −$63.08) |
| Slot 1 | **GLD** 0.249121 sh @ $426.74 ($106.31) — bought this cycle |
| Slot 2 | **XLE** 1.697789 sh @ $62.6167 ($106.31) — bought this cycle |
| Cash | $2.01 free + **$370.38 unsettled** (XLF/SPY proceeds, settle 2026-08-26) |
| Options sleeve | Empty — gate open, but **no conforming GLD call is affordable**: Oct $425C (0.556Δ, 52 DTE) marks $1,907.50 vs a $292.55 premium cap. **Owner decision 2026-08-25: wait for a bigger account — do NOT relax the delta/DTE spec to fit.** The sleeve stays gated by the Risk Rules v2 §4 premium cap and re-arms on its own once the account is large enough that a conforming contract fits (~$3,800+ for GLD-class names, less for XLF/XLE). Accepted that it idles meanwhile (see [[2026-08-25 Daily Signals]]) |
| Circuit-breaker | $325 (50% of contributed capital) — checked first, account at 1.80× |

## Standing schedule

**Scheduler installed 2026-08-25 (launchd).** The 14-day gap is fixed: three `launchd` agents in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (`com.dfeldman.trading.*`) now fire on weekdays, machine-local time = ET (DST-tracked):

| Time (ET) | Agent | Script | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9:30 AM | daily-cycle | `run-daily-cycle.sh` | **Full** rotation (signals → sells → buys → log → push) |
| 12:30 PM | market-check-midday | `run-market-check.sh` | **Risk exits only** — breaker + protective sleeve close; no buys/rotation |
| 3:45 PM | market-check-close | `run-market-check.sh` | Same risk-exits-only check, 15 min before close |

- The two intraday checks run the canonical `automation/market-check-prompt.md`: circuit-breaker first, then close the options sleeve only if the underlying's 20-day return turned negative or the contract is <21 DTE. They **never** buy or rotate — rebalancing is the 9:30 cycle's job alone.
- **Trade-log mirror:** every run copies `trading-vault/Trades/*.md` into `~/Documents/Obsidian Vault/Trading/` via `automation/mirror-trades.sh` (one-way; the repo stays the git source of truth).
- **Root cause of the old gap:** there was never any cron/launchd entry at all — the 08-05 and 08-25 runs were both manual. Liveness now visible via `automation/logs/launchd-*.{out,err}` and the per-run `cycle-*`/`check-*` logs.
- Kill switch: `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.dfeldman.trading.<label>` for any agent, or revoke the Robinhood connector.
- Machine must be awake at the fire time; if asleep, launchd runs the job once on wake.
- Still untested: `review_option_order` / `place_option_order` under the desktop allowlist. Nothing affordable came up to exercise them.
- **Next cycle (Wed 2026-08-26, 9:30 ET):** rotation checks on GLD/XLE; $370.38 settles overnight and is deployable. Sleeve stays empty while GLD holds slot 1 — it only becomes reachable if slot 1 rotates to XLF or XLE, and only once an affordable conforming contract exists.
